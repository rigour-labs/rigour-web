# Rigour Labs

> Deterministic quality gates for AI-generated code. The strategic engineering layer that stops AI chaos.

## What is Rigour?

Rigour is a local-first, zero-telemetry code quality enforcement tool designed specifically for AI coding agents. It provides deterministic PASS/FAIL quality gates that force AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Cline, GitHub Copilot) to meet strict engineering standards before marking tasks as done.

## Core Problem We Solve

AI coding agents ship broken, insecure, and architecturally inconsistent code. They lack engineering rigor. Rigour adds the quality control loop that AI agents are missing.

## Products

### Rigour CLI
The core engine for quality gates. Runs locally with zero external dependencies.
- Install: `npx @rigour-labs/cli check`
- NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rigour-labs/cli
- GitHub: https://github.com/rigour-labs/rigour

### Rigour MCP Server
Model Context Protocol server for direct integration with AI coding assistants.
- Integrates with: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf
- Provides real-time quality feedback in the AI agent loop
- Documentation: https://docs.rigour.run/mcp

### Rigour Bot (GitHub App)
Automatic PR review bot that enforces quality gates on every pull request.
- GitHub Marketplace: https://github.com/apps/rigour-bot
- Webhook endpoint: bot.rigour.run

## Key Features

1. **Deep Analysis**: LLM-powered analysis verifying SOLID principles, design patterns, concurrency safety, and architecture quality across 40+ code quality categories
2. **Static Policy Gates**: Enforce coding standards, naming conventions, file structure rules
3. **Semantic Pattern Index**: Detect architectural violations and anti-patterns
4. **Security Analysis**: Identify hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities
5. **Performance Checks**: Flag N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms
6. **Dependency Auditing**: Check for vulnerable or deprecated packages

## Deep Analysis Pipeline

Rigour's deep analysis feature uses a three-step LLM-powered approach:
1. **AST-Based Parsing**: Extract code structure, patterns, and relationships
2. **LLM Analysis**: Apply deep reasoning across 40+ quality categories including:
   - SOLID Principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
   - Design Pattern Detection (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
   - Concurrency & Threading Analysis
   - Architectural Consistency & Layering
   - Complexity & Maintainability Metrics
3. **AST Verification**: Validate findings against actual code structure

Supports: Go, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Rust

## Strategic Values

- **Local-First**: Your code never leaves your machine. Zero telemetry.
- **Deterministic**: PASS/FAIL is clear and reproducible. No ambiguity.
- **Agent-Native**: Built to integrate into AI agent loops (Claude Code, Cursor Agent, etc.)
- **Fast**: Sub-second analysis for most codebases
- **Extensible**: Custom rules via YAML configuration
- **Deep Intelligence**: LLM-powered analysis verified by AST for semantic code understanding

## Use Cases

- Enforce architectural boundaries in AI-generated code
- Prevent AI agents from shipping security vulnerabilities
- Maintain consistent code style across AI-assisted PRs
- Quality gates in CI/CD pipelines
- Real-time feedback for AI pair programming

## Technical Specifications

- Written in: TypeScript/Node.js
- Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- License: MIT (CLI), Proprietary (Bot)
- Supported Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java
