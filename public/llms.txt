# Rigour Labs

Deterministic quality gates for AI-generated code.

## Core Philosophy
Rigour adds the engineering loops where AI agents usually fail. We provide local-first, zero-telemetry tools that force agents to meet strict engineering standards before marking tasks as done.

## Products
- **Rigour CLI**: The engine for quality gates. `npx @rigour-labs/cli check`.
- **MCP Server**: Integration for Cursor, Cline, and Gemini.
- **VS Code Extension**: Real-time architectural violation feedback (Coming Q2 2026).

## Strategic Values
- **Local-First**: Code never leaves the developer's machine.
- **Deterministic**: PASS/FAIL is clear and reproducible.
- **Agent-Native**: Built to integrate into AI agent loops (Claude Code, etc.).
